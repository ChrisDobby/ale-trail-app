# Ale trail planner!

Turns out we need a planner for our annual ale trail which also gave me a chance to do something with the fantasic [Remix](https://docs.remix.run).

Created from this [Remix netlify template](https://app.netlify.com/start/deploy?repository=https://github.com/ascorbic/remix-on-netlify)

## Setup

Set the environment variable `REMIX_TOKEN` to your licence key from the Remix dashboard. If your site repo is not public, you could edit `.npmrc` and hard-code the value, but be careful to not commit it to a public repo.

## Development

To run the Remix dev server, run:

```
$ yarn dev

```

Open up [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and you should be ready to go!
